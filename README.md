# Art-style-shaders-for-OpenMW
These shaders for [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/) change the realistic style of Morrowind to a handdrawn one.

## MWToon
Makes Morrowind look like a comic book or a Borderlands game.

Inspired by the (no longer supported) MWToon texture pack by PeterBitt.

## Watercolored
Makes Morrowind look like a watercolor painting.

Inspired by the [Watercolored v2 texture pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43375/) by PeterBitt.

Based on the [MGE XE Watercolor Shader](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49473/) by Kamikaze1.
